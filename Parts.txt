1. Design the SHAFT.
The SHAFT in the attached drawings is
illustrative. Your design will be a much
more complex shaft. Only the part of the
SHAFT marked with a thick green line in the
assembly drawing (DRIVE HEAD, #005,
SHEET 3) may be changed. Add the
necessary annotation. The design must
make provision for bearing seating and
radial shaft seals (choose from the VP series
in the catalogue) for the END CAP and BASE
COVER. You must also incorporate the use
of at least one circlip in the shaft design.
The SHAFT will be manufactured from
STEEL 1431/350WA

4. Make the BASE COVER drawing.
Annotate the holes for the shaft and the M8
bolts connecting the BASE COVER to the
BODY. Design the seating for the radial
shaft seal (choose from the VP series in the
catalogue) housed in the BASE COVER, with
annotation as necessary. Design and
annotate the interface between the BASE
COVER and the BODY, and between the
BASE COVER and the bearing. No other
dimensions necessary. Only the parts
marked with the thick blue line in the
assembly drawing (DRIVE HEAD, #005,
SHEET 3) may be changed. The CASING
COVER will be manufactured from cast iron
